At the time of the maximum load value, **04/23/2024 20:00:00**, the price was **40.91**. This indicates that the game type is **"SHEDPOWER"** with an award level of **"GOLD"**.

Notifications about the detected grid peak have been dispatched to the required network nodes (C2Agent, CommandCenter, and ControlPanel).

- **Minimum Load**: 74868
- **Average Price**: 26.61
- **Maximum Price**: 40.91

The time of the maximum load value was **04/23/2024 20:00:00**, with the corresponding price at that time being **40.91**. According to the criteria for determining the game type and award level, this scenario qualifies for the game type **"SHEDPOWER"** with an award level of **"GOLD"**.

Notifications and control signals for the detected grid peak have been previously dispatched to the required network nodes as per the outlined actions for such results.
