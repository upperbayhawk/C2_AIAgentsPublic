[2024-04-25 09:33:47.318918] DEBUG: runsink: why is the sky blue?
[2024-04-25 09:34:24.685475] DEBUG: runsink: 
[2024-04-25 09:34:56.835107] DEBUG: runsink: The sky appears blue to the human eye due to the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is made up of light of various colors, each of which has a different wavelength. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules, particles, and water droplets, which causes the light to scatter in all directions.

Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors in the spectrum of visible light. Due to its shorter wavelength, blue light is scattered more than other colors when sunlight passes through the atmosphere. This scattering causes the blue hue of the sky in all directions during the daytime. During sunrise and sunset, the sky often appears red or orange because the sunlight is passing through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, which scatters away most of the shorter wavelength light (blue and green) and allows the longer wavelength light (red, orange) to reach our eyes.
[2024-04-25 09:36:56.108643] DEBUG: runsink: How accurate is National Weather Service temp forecasts
[2024-04-25 09:37:11.581094] DEBUG: runsink: The accuracy of the National Weather Service (NWS) temperature forecasts, like all weather forecasts, can vary based on several factors, including the time frame of the forecast, the specific location, and the weather conditions being forecasted. Generally, short-term forecasts (1-3 days in advance) are more accurate than long-term forecasts.

Studies on the performance of the National Weather Service have shown that their short-term temperature forecasts are quite accurate. For forecasts made 1 to 3 days in advance, the NWS temperature predictions typically have an average absolute error of around 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that the predicted temperature is usually within a few degrees of the actual observed temperature.

As the forecast extends further out in time, the accuracy can decrease due to the inherent unpredictability of the weather and the limitations of current forecasting models. By the time forecasts reach 7 to 10 days in advance, the variability and errors can increase significantly.

It's also worth noting that the NWS continuously updates its models and methods to improve forecast accuracy. They utilize a wide array of data from satellites, radars, weather stations, and other sources, which are analyzed by sophisticated computer models to generate forecasts. Additionally, human meteorologists play a crucial role in interpreting model data, adjusting forecasts based on their expertise, and often improving the accuracy beyond what models alone can achieve.

In summary, while no weather forecast can be 100% accurate, the National Weather Service provides highly reliable short-term temperature forecasts, with accuracy gradually decreasing for longer-term forecasts.

[2024-04-25 18:30:38.628522] DEBUG: runsink: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with seven columns. A datetime value, a load data value and a price data value for the grid system, the temperature forecast and weather condition forecast, the load and price for the local area. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the load and price data and for the local load and price data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum load value and the price at that time and the local load and price data. Store the maximum forecast temperature using the function putSensorValueByName with the name "MaxTempForecast" If the maximum price value is greater than 40, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP to the price when the load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins. What is the projected_peak_datetime_ept and pjm_load_forecast in the operations report JSON data?
