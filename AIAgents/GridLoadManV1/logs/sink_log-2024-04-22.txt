[2024-04-22 09:30:05.244913] DEBUG: runsink: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with three columns. A datetime value, a load data value and a price data value. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the load and price data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum load value and the price at that time. If the maximum price value is greater than 40, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP to the price when the load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the value was selected and set the duration to 120 mins.
