Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values of the load and price data and for the local load and price data for all the data values and save the time of the maximum load value and the price at that time and the local load and price data. Store the maximum forecast temperature using the function putSensorValueByName with the name "MaxTempForecast" If the maximum price value is greater than 40, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the value is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the value is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". Set the PeakLmp to the price. If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. The number of hours is 2. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". The LMP to the price when the load value is maximum.
