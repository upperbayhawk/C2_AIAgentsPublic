### Statistics Summary:

  - Maximum: 78,432 (occurring at 20:00)
  - Minimum: 70,519
  - Standard Deviation: 2,114.26
- **Price**:
  - Average: 22.57
  - Maximum: 39.02 (occurring at 20:00)

  - Average: 21.46
  - Maximum: 35.26 (occurring at 20:00)
  - Minimum: 16.19
  - Standard Deviation: 5.22

The highest values for Load, Price, and LocalLoad all occur at 20:00, with a Load of 78,432, a Price of 39.02, and a LocalLoad of 1,770. This indicates the peak period for these parameters on this date.

Since the maximum Load and maximum LocalLoad values do not exceed the thresholds of 130,000 and 3,500, respectively, and the maximum Price is greater than 25 but does not exceed 30, the resultant game type is **"SHEDPOWER"** with an award level of **"BRONZE"**. The start time for the event is at **20:00**, coinciding with the maximum Price occurrence, and the corresponding LMP for the award criteria is **39.02**.

Given this scenario triggers a GridPeakDetected event, a message will be sent with these details to the specified network nodes.

If these two conditions are not met then if the maximum Price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum Price and the LMP is the Price at the maximum Load. Otherwise, if the maximum Price is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE", the startime is the Datetime of the maximum Price and the LMP is the maximum Price.
