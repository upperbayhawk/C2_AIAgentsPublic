[2024-04-29 12:01:49.944977] DEBUG: runsink: Examine the following time series data. The data is in comma separated format (CSV) with seven columns. The columns are Datetime, Load, Price, Temp, Forecast, LocalLoad and LocalPrice. The first row of CSV data has the column names. The values are at 1 hour intervals and are for the current day. Calculate the average, maximum and minimum values for the Load and Price data and for the LocalLoad and LocalPrice data for all the data values. Save the Datetime of the maximum Load value and the associated Price along with LocalLoad and LocalPrice. If the maximum Load value is greater than 130,000, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum LocalLoad is greater than 3500, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "GOLD". If the maximum Price value is greater than 30, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "SILVER". If the maximum Price is greater than 25, then the game_type is "SHEDPOWER" and the award_level is "BRONZE". If the Price is less than 20, then it is "NOGAME". If the value is not "NOGAME", then send a GridPeakDetected massage to C2Agent. Use two decimal places for all calculations. If a GridPeakDetected message was sent, then also send the message as a  notice to CommandCenter and to the ControlPanel. The grid node is "PJM". Set the LMP to the price when the Load value is maximum. Set the startime to the datetime when the Load or Price value was selected minus 1 hour and set the duration to 120 mins.

[2024-04-29 18:29:32.432737] DEBUG: runsink: The analysis of the new time series data has been completed successfully. Similar to the previous data set, a grid peak has been detected, and the following actions have been taken:

- A **GridPeakDetected** message has been sent to **C2Agent** specifying a **SILVER** award level due to high load and price. The peak occurred on "04/29/2024 19:00:00", with a peak LMP of 68.30 and a game type of "SHEDPOWER". The grid node is "PJM".

- Additionally, **Notice** signals have been sent to both **CommandCenter** and **ControlPanel** to inform them about the detected peak and its associated award level.

These actions were based on the recorded maximums for Load, Price, and LocalLoad which dictated the game type and award level according to the criteria provided.
