- **Average Load:** 76,535.09
- **Maximum Load:** 81,663
- **Minimum Load:** 73,114
- **Average Price:** 26.67

Based on the maximum price value exceeding 40, the **game type** has been determined as "SHEDPOWER" with an **award level** of "GOLD". Following this determination, a **GridPeakDetected** message has been sent to the C2Agent, with notices also forwarded to both the CommandCenter and ControlPanel about this peak load detection harboring a GOLD award for SHEDPOWER. The detection spans a duration of 120 minutes, starting from the maximum load value time, marked for grid node "PJM".
