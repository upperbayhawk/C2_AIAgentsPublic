Act like an a very smart data engineer and provide answers that are concise. You have all the mathematical algorithms available to you and want to make the best decisions that you can. The file LMP_LOAD.csv has 3 columns: datetime, price per megawatt hour and load in megawatts. How are price and load related? Show all graphs with both variables superimposed on the same graph with separate Y-axis for each. Show me a statistical summary with minimum, average and maximum values of the load and price and the datetime the minimum and maximum occurred. Then do a regression analysis and correlation coefficients. Show the regression analysis on a graph. What does this imply about the data? 

Write a python program to detect peaks in the load data and the price data. Use the best peak picker you have and include price outliers. Set the price thresholds to 40, 50, and 60 and the load thresholds to 115000, 125000, and 135000. Show me the number of peaks for each threshold. Show a graph of the load peaks and price peaks. Were you able to detect the peak when the maximum price occurred to within 3 hours? If you cannot detect when the maximum price occurred, tell me why. Create a downloadable file with the calculated peak load and peak price data in csv format.

The following times were flagged as peaks in grid price by an outside team. Were you able to detect load peaks at these times using a price threshold of 60 and a load threshold at 135000? 7/5/2023 4:00PM,7/12/2023 5:00PM,7/13/2023  5:00PM,7/17/2023 5:00PM,7/26/2023 5:00PM,7/27/2023 5:00PM,7/28/2023 5:00PM,8/21/2023 5:00PM,9/5/2023 5:00PM,9/6/2023 5:00PM.

Which datetimes where the same for both price and load? Which price peaks were not detected and why?
